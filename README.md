# MyJourney

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was build as a **development milestone project** for the completion of the user centric frontend module and it's part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

A live **desktop demo** can be found [here](https://gaspar91.github.io/MyJourney2/).

The **source code** for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gaspar91/MyJourney2).

# UX

This website was build as a source of turism in Portugal in order to help travellers and locals to enjoy what the country has to offer.

The website offers users the opportunity to discover the country though their services with a user pack which provides guided tours, accomodation and activities.

The company wants to provide a positive and fun experience, and it's aware of the users needs, so it provides guided tours in order to take turists to unique and popular places to visit and after a long day a bedroom is provided so turists can rest and they will have breakfast served to them every morning as included in the services.

There are also many activities, for all ages, that the company provides in order to keep the experience enjoyable for everyone.


# Design Process XXXXXX

You'll be able to view the pc, mobile and tablet sketches, wireframes, mock for this project in the **Wireframes** folder, located within the **Static** folder in the  [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/MyJourney).

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes, so you might need the program in order to view some of the documents.


# User Stories

### User Story One:

As a tourist coming to a new country or region I would like to be able to discover new places without getting lost. I would also like to go to specific places that I might have heard about or that I know that it's important to visit as a turist but I dont't want to waist time figuring out which way to go and which means of transportation to take, so it's great to go with a tour guide that knows the area.

### User Story Two:

As someone who likes to travel with familly, including children, it's important to me that there are activities for them to keep entertained and also have a fun experience.

### User Story Three:

It's important to me to see what the company provides and I like to do that beforehand through social media, with images and other people's comments, this enables me to know what to expect of the place I'm going to visit or stay in.

### User Story Three:

It is also important to me that I have easy access to the website, so if I can search for it when I'm walking or I'm far away from my computer I can just search for it on my phone or tablet.

### User Story Four:

As someone who doesn't like to waist time with giving to much detail, filling up a short and quick form, in order to get more information out of a service is really nice and motivates me to do it.

### User Story Five:

It is also important that there is access to a phone number or email address in order for me to obtain more information.

# Features

## Existing Features

- The website is divided into four seccions. 
- The navigation bar scrolls down to the last seccion of the page.
- The logo is in the top corner left and the seccions are on the top corner right.
- As you scroll down the seccion name will be higlithed in order to let the user know in which seccion of the page it is.
- The bottom of the page contains a footer with social media links which open in a new page.

- In order to ensure that the user first knows what the website has to offer the home seccion contains a “Start” button, In the middle of the screen, that leads to the "About" seccion.
- The “About” seccion provides a paragraph with information about what the website refers to and it contains a “Read More” button that will lead to the “Features” seccion.
- Once In the “Features” seccion the user can browse and click on one of the three images with a tittle and a small description that will take them to the "contact” seccion.
- The “Contact” seccion contains a small form, in order for the user to subscribe.
- The "Contact" seccion also contains contact information in the bottom left corner of the footer and social media icons in the bottom right corner of the footer.

## Features Left to Implement

- In future versions of the website I would like to implement some **video content** and an **image gallery** in order to make the website more appealing and help the user see what the company can provide in order to incentivate the user to register.
- I would also like to implement a **keyword search** box in the nav bar so that if user's wish to search for something by name they can locate something as quick as possible.
- I would also like to create a **banner about new deals** that are or will be available to make the user be aware of what the company can offer.
- I would also like to create a **comment section** so users can see how satisfied the previous users were with the company and the services provided.
- I would also like to place a **map with all our locations** in order to provide tourists with an easier access to where to find the company.
- I would also like it to be possible for when the user click on the phone number or the email, it would **call or open the email app** in order to allow an easier access of information to the user.
- I believe a **Popup Chat Window** would be a good way to make the website more efficient if the user needs imediate information and doesn't want to wait for an email or doesn't want to make a phone call.

# Observations

- The website has been checked for responsiveness on a multitude of screen sizes from PC to portable devices, such as tablets and mobile phones.

  - As far as vertical screens most features were found to be fully responsive and fit well within each screen size.
  - On the other hand, horizontal screens didn't respond so well and some of the features don't fit properly.

- Another problem I found was that, in the Iphone5/SE screen, the background image doesn't cover the whole screen. I tried changing the settings but not much happens. Sometimes when I would refresh the page it would fill the screen, but after some time it would be missing a part of the image.

- One more problem I found was that the Features seccion takes a while to load, because the image is quite large.

- All HTML and CSS code was run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and returned no errors.
